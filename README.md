# Sumobot Beginner Competition

The McMaster Sumobot Competition is a robotics organization that challenges students to design their own autonomous fighting robots, which are pitted against each other in tournament-style, one-on-one wrestling matches.
The beginner competition is for people who are new to Arduino and prototyping autonomous robots.
